This patch was made for the 3.5.1 version of A* Pathfinding Project, and there is
no guarantee that it will work with future releases. Though once the author returns,
hopefully there won't be a need for this patch.

I did not write all of the code in this repo. This is a user made patch for the BFS function, 
which was bugged and was not functioning as intended. The full .CS file is simply 
included for ease of installation. Yes, there will be a slight performance hit 
increase due to the function actually computing the data that it was supposed too. 

Enjoy,
