I did not write all of the code in this repo. I patched the BFS function, which was
bugged and was not functioning as intended. The full .CS file is simply included for
ease of installation. Yes, there will be a slight performance hit increase due to 
the function actually computing the data that it was supposed too. 

Enjoy,
